Challenges faced during the project: My most chanalgin part was to figure out how to filter the list by category or status. I could not make it woek with Java Script.     
How you approached solving those challenges: I am still working on filter section to make it work and improve the funcanality of the application.       
What you would improve if given more time: If I woud given more time I would work on css to designe the app better. i would also improve the funcanalaty fo the application by adding more buttons and options.
